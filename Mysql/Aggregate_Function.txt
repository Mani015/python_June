Aggregate fucntion:
There are 5 here:
Avg(),count(),max(),min(),sum()

select * from table_name where column > 50000;
select * from emp where salary > 50000;

count():
select count(salary) from emp where salary>20000;
select sum(salary) from emp where salary>30000;
select avg(salary) from emp where salary>30000;
select min(salary) from emp where salary>40000;
select max(salary) from emp where salary>40000;

The GROUP BY statement groups rows that have the same values into summary rows, like "find the number of customers in each country".

The GROUP BY statement is often used with aggregate functions (COUNT(), MAX(), MIN(), SUM(), AVG()) to group the result-set by one or more columns.
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column_name(s)
ORDER BY column_name(s);

select age,count(age) from emp group by age;

select age,count(age) from emp group by age having age order by age;

select location,count(location) from emp group by location;


SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
FROM Customers
GROUP BY Country
ORDER BY COUNT(CustomerID) DESC;

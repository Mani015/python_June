# Python is an interpreted and general-purpose programming language that emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation.
# Python is a general-purpose, high-level, interpreted, object-oriented programming language used for various applications.



# Python was developed by Guido Van Rossum in 1989 while working at National Research Institute in the Netherlands.
# But officially, Python was made available to the public in 1991.


# Python code syntax uses English keywords, making it easy to understand.
# Therefore, Python is recommended as the first programming language for beginners

x = 4

# x is a variable name/objectname/identifier it is to stored 4 insdie of x
#  4 is data/value/information

# import keyword
#
# print(keyword.kwlist)




# Applications of Python
# We can use Python everywhere because Python is known for its general-purpose nature,
# which makes it applicable in almost every domain of software development. The most common application areas are:
#
# Desktop Applications
# Web Applications
# Database Applications
# Network Programming
# Games
# Data Analysis Applications
# Machine Learning
# Artificial Intelligence Applications
# IoT

# print('hello world')


# Indentation
# Python indentation tells a Python interpreter that the group of statements belongs to a particular block of code.
# The indentation makes the code look neat, clean, and more readable.

# space at the beging of code line

# x1 = [1,2,3,4,5,1,2,3,4,5,1]
# d1 ={}
# for i in x1:
#     if i in d1:
#         d1[i]+=1
#     else:
#         d1[i]=1
# print(d1)

# print('hello python')

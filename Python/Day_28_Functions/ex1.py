# In Python, a function is a block of organized,
# reusable code that performs a specific task.
# Functions are a fundamental concept in programming and play a
# crucial role in structuring code, promoting reusability,
# and making code easier to understand and maintain.

# Functions there are two types:
# 1).Pre defined Functions/Built-in Functions
# 2).user defined functions


# Built-in Functions:
# Python provides a set of built-in functions that are available without needing to import any modules.
# These functions include print(), len(), type(), input(), int(), str(), and many more.
# They perform various basic operations and manipulations.

l1 = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
print(l1)
print(len(l1))
print(type(l1))
print(max(l1))
print(sum(l1))
print(min(l1))




# [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

# <class 'list'>

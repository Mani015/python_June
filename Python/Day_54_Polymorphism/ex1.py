# What is Polymorphism?
# The literal meaning of polymorphism is the condition of occurrence in different forms.

# Polymorphism is a very important concept in programming.
# It refers to the use of a single type entity (method, operator or object)
# to represent different types in different scenarios.

# One person can do a multiple tasks
# ex: print(),len(),input(),str,int,

a = 10
b = 20
#  + plays more than one role
print(a+b) #30
x = 'sridhar'
y = 'reddy'

print(x+y)
# Sridharreddy

print(a*b)
# 200
print(x+y*3)

# sridharreddyreddyreddy


# Polymorphic len() function
# print(len("Programiz"))
# print(len(["Python", "Java", "C"]))
# print(len({"Name": "John", "Address": "Nepal"}))

# Conditional statements
# In Python, condition statements act depending on whether a given condition is true or false. You can execute different blocks of codes depending on the outcome of a condition. Condition statements always evaluate to either True or False.
#
#
# There are three types of conditional statements.
#
# if statement
# if-else
# if-elif-else
# nested if-else

# If statement in Python
# In control statements, The if statement is the simplest form. It takes a condition and evaluates to either True or False.
#
# If the condition is True, then the True block of code will be executed, and if the condition is False, then the block of code is skipped, and The controller moves to the next line
#
# Syntax of the if statement
#
# if condition:
#      statement 1
#      statement 2
#      statement n

import keyword
# print(keyword.kwlist)

x = eval(input('Enter your condition:'))
if x:
    print('the condition True, if will be open')

print('you are in new line')
